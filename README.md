# My Virtual Library
 
A small and simple book collection project created with **HTML**, **CSS** and **Vanilla JavaScript**. This project is part of the [Odin Project Curicullum](https://www.theodinproject.com/).

The design is really simple and clean (using Bootstrap), my major focus was on learning to use LocalStorage.

**Add** books you want to read or you already have read to your collection! You can also **delete** a book from your shelf or **update** its status. Your data will be stored in **LocalStorage** so you can keep track of your reading.

ðŸ”— Live preview of the project is [here](https://my-virtual-library.vercel.app/#).

Happy reading! :closed_book: :smiley:
